=== HTMLBook

Let's write books in HTML! HTMLBook is an open HTML5-based XML standard for the authoring and production of both print and digital books. HTMLBook is built on the following premises::

* Books are timeless. The basic "book" structure has persisted for hundreds of years and will continue to persist for our lifetimes, be it in digital or print form. 
* HTML is the markup language of the world for the foreseeable future.
* Single-source document processing will remain valuable for the foreseeable future.

As such, HTMLBook can be characterized in the following ways:

* HTMLBook is a subset of XHTML5. All HTMLBook is HTML5, but not all HTML5 is HTMLBook.
* HTMLBook contains no additional elements or attributes outside of the HTML5 specification.
* HTMLBook is semantically tailored to the structure of a "book" (including more complex content used in technical and reference documents).
* HTMLBook is defined with and can be validated against an XML schema.
* HTMLBook templates can be written in CSS.

=== Getting Started with HTMLBook

* Read the Working Draft of the HTMLBook Specification here:

https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook/blob/master/specification.asciidoc

* Get the HTMLBook schema here:

https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook/tree/master/schema

The main HTMLBook Schema file is +htmlbook.xsd+, which imports Schemas (via W3C) for MathML and SVG validation.

You can validate HTML documents against +htmlbook.xsd+ on the command line using +xmllint+:

----
$ xmllint --noout --schema htmlbook.xsd <your_html_filename>.html
----

Alternatively, to validate in a GUI XML editor like oXygen, add a +xsi:schemaLocation+ declaration to the root +<html>+ element as follows:

----
<html xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
 xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml ../schema/htmlbook.xsd"
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
----

=== Notes on HTMLBook

* The HTMLBook specification is currently in Working Draft status, and will continue to be developed and revised for the foreseeable future.

* If you have any bugs or feature requests for HTMLBook, please submit them via the Issues tab in GitHub

* In the coming months, we will be adding additional tools to the HTMLBook project for authoring and producing books with HTMLBook: CSS stylesheets, scripts for generating EPUB/Mobi, etc.

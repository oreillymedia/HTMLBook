    <h1 class="title">Join the Publishing Revolution</h1>
    <p>Thank you for your interest in Atlas! Atlas is a wiki-like, git-managed authoring platform for creating books. If you haven't already, you may want to check out the <a href="http://atlas.labs.oreilly.com/getting_started">getting started video</a><a class="indexterm" data-primary="video" data-secondary="introduction to Atlas"/>.</p>

   <video class="video" src="media/welcome_to_atlas.mp4" controls="controls" preload="auto" width="500" height="300" poster="images/welcome_to_atlas.png"></video>

   <p>Some of the features of Atlas are as follows:</p>

   <dl>
     
     <dt>Simple markup</dt>
     <dd>Atlas supports <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/index.html">AsciiDoc</a> and, for simpler projects <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.</dd>

     <dt>Git backend</dt>
     <dd>If you have a book, you have a <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> repository and all of the power and convenience that comes with using git version control.</dd>

     <dt>Easy book and ebook builds</dt>
     <dd>Atlas lets you build your project in three formats at any time: Mobi (for the Kindle), EPUB (for most other ebook platforms), and PDF. Atlas also gives you tools to debug your ebook formats so that you can identify and fix problems quickly.</dd>

     <dt>An invitation system</dt>
     <dd>Add collaborators to your project at any time by simply sending an invite.</dd>

     <dt>Flexible writing options</dt>
     <dd>You can write directly within Atlas, but if writing in a web browser is not for you, no problem. Just use git to clone your book to a local machine and write in the text editor of your choice.</dd>

   </dl>

   <section class="sect1" id="howitworks">
     <h1>How It Works</h1>

     <ol>
     	<li>Receive an invite<a class="indexterm" data-primary="invitation"/> from an O’Reilly editor or another author and create an account.</li>
     	<li>Write in AsciiDoc, an open source text format developed by <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/">Stuart Rackham</a>. Each time you save a file, it will be logged into a git repository, so it’s always under version control.</li>
     	<li>When you're ready, build your book. Atlas interfaces with O’Reilly's publishing toolchain, generating PDF, EPUB, and Mobi files for you on the fly. Theebook files look just like those for sale on oreilly.com.</li>
     </ol>

     <p>Why bother with this, you ask? We're trying to create an appealing authoring process that will get you writing as quickly as possible.</p>

   </section>

   <section class="sect1" id="startwritingtoday">
     <h1>Start Writing Today</h1>

     <p>We’re just getting started with Atlas, and you can play a role in determining future development by using the platform to write your book. If you’re willing to use Atlas, we ask that you:</p>

     <ul>
     	<li>Write in AsciiDoc, which is the preferred formats for Atlas.</li>
     	<li>Provide feedback. Atlas is currently in alpha testing, and we need to hear from you to take the platform to the next level. To submit feedback, simply click on the Feedback tab within Atlas and create an Issue. You will need a GitHub account to create an Issue. If you’re not able or willing to provide feedback, Atlas might not be right for you at this time.</li>
     </ul>

     <p>If the above sounds good to you, then you’re the perfect candidate to work in Atlas. We’re eager to help you get started. Let’s revolutionize publishing together!</p>

  <section class="chapter" id="writehowyouwant">
  	<h1>Write How You Want</h1>

  	<p>When you are using Atlas to write your book, you have the option of writing in the wiki interface<a class="indexterm" data-primary="wiki interface"/> or locally on your own computer. This chapter covers each of those scenarios. As you write your book, you can jump back and forth between the two writing environments. As long as you are saving in the web interface or using git to `push` and `pull` from your local machine, you'll always be in sync.</p>

  	<div class="note">
  	  <h5>Get Your Gravatar</h5>
  	  <p>You<a class="indexterm" data-primary="gravatar"/> may notice that some users have personal icons in the Changes and Collaborators sections of Atlas. Those image icons are pulled in from <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a>, based on the user's email address. Set up your Gravatar to get a more personalized icon.</p>

  	  <h1>Working in the Atlas Wiki</h1>

  	  <p>If you've used a wiki before, you will find the Atlas interface to be very familiar. In the following sections, you'll learn how to create and edit new files in the wiki interface.</p>

  	  <aside class="sidebar">
  	  	<h5>Invite Some Collaborators</h5>
  	  	<p>Once you are working on a project in Atlas, you can invite additional collaborators<a class="indexterm" data-primary="collaborators" data-secondary="inviting" /> at any time. First, create your project. Then, click on the Collaborators tab. Enter the mail address of anyone you'd like to collaborate with on your project. If you choose a permission type of Collaborator, the invited author will have full read and write access to your project, via the wiki interface and the git repository.</p>
  	  	<p>You can also remove collaborators using the same Collaborators tab.</p>

        <h2>Working with AsciiDoc Text in Atlas</h2>
        
        <p>When you're working in the Atlas wiki interface, you will need to write in AsciiDoc.<a href="#ftn1" id="ftnref1" class="noteref">1</a> See <a class="xref" href="#intro_to_asc">Chapter 4</a> for an introduction to AsciiDoc markup.</p>

        <p>The Atlas wiki editor works just as you'd expect. Use the buttons to insert simple AsciiDoc markup. For example, <a class="xref" href="#atlas_editor">Figure 2-2</a> shows what happens when you click the H1 button.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>Once you've entered some text, click Save and your changes will be committed to a git repository that is created automatically each time you start a new book. Optionally, you can enter a log message<a class="indexterm" data-primary="entering a log message"/> before you click Save, and it will be included with the commit to the git repository, as show in <a class="xref" href="#log_message">Figure 2-3</a>.

      <section class="sect2" id="adding_images">
        <h2>Adding Images via the Atlas Interface</h2>
        
        <p>You can upload images to your book directly in the Atlas wiki interface. Click on Image manager and then select Choose File and finally Upload, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#image_upload">Figure 2-4</a>.</p>

        <figure id="image_upload">
          <figcaption><span class="figure-label">Figure 2-4.</span> Upload your images within Atlas</figcaption>
          <img src="images/image_upload.png" alt="A screenshot of the Atlas image uploader"/>
        </figure>

        <p>Once you've uploaded your image, Atlas will generate a thumbnail preview of that image, which you can see at any time by bringing up the Image manager.</p>

        <div class="note">
          <p>At this time, if you upload an image via git, the image will not have a thumbnail preview within the Image manager.</p>
        </div>

        <p>You can also use the Image manager to insert the AsciiDoc reference to that image:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Place the cursor where you'd like to insert the image within the text.</li>
            <li>Click on Image manager.</li>
            <li>Select the thumbnail preview of the image you've uploaded and click Insert (<a class="xref" href="insert_image_asciidoc">Figure 2-5</a>).</li>

      <h1>Tracking Changes in Atlas</h1>

      <p>Each time you save a change in the wiki interface or use git to push a change to your repository (as described in <a href="committing_and_pushing">Committing and Pushing</a>), Atlas displays that change on the Changes tab.</p>

      <figure id="changes_in_atlas">
          <figcaption><span class="figure-label">Figure 2-6.</span> An Atlas change box shows additions and deletions made to the text</figcaption>

      </figure>

      <a class="xref" href="#changes_in_atlas">Figure 2-6</a> shows a change that was saved to the repository via a <code>git push</code>. In this change notification box, Atlas displays the author who made the change along with the log message used during <code>git commit</code>. If the author were to use the Save button on the wiki interface (instead of git), as explained in <a class="xref" href="working_with_asciidoc_text">Working with AsciiDoc Text in Atlas</a>, the change would be captured and displayed in the same way.

    </section>

    <section class="sect1" id="working_locally">
      <h1>Working Locally</h1>

      <p>Atlas sits on top of a git repository, giving you the flexibility to write how and when you want. For example, suppose you have a long flight and want to write edit on the plane. No problem—just pull down your book files, make your changes locally, and then push them back up when you're connected to the Internet again. Or perhaps you'd rather skip the wiki interface entirely and work on your local machine exclusively. That's fine too.</p>

      <section class="sect2" id="cloning_your_book">
        <h2>Cloning Your Book</h2>

        <p>In order to work locally, you will need to have <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> installed on your machine. The following section describes a few basic git commands to get you up and running, but see <a href="using_git_with_atlas">Using Git with Atlas</a> for more details around using git with Atlas.</p>

        <p>Once you have git installed, click on the Metadata tab in the Atlas interface to retrieve your git repository URL, as shown in <a class="xref" href="git_repo_url">Figure 2-7</a>.</p>

        <figure id="git_repo_url">
          <figcaption><span class="figure-label">Figure 2-7.</span> Grab your git repository URL from the Metadata tab</figcaption>
          <img src="images/git_repo_url.png" alt="A screenshot of the Metadata tab in Atlas showing the git URL"/>
        </figure>

        <p>Now that you have the URL, you can use git to clone it to your computer. Use the `git clone` command and enter your Atlas password. When you clone the repo, you can optionally add the name of the directory, like so:</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">$ git clone https://adam%40oreilly.com@atlas-admin.oreilly.com/git/1230000000065.git

        <p>The <code>clone</code> command will download all of the files into a directory named <em>getting_started_with_atlas</em>, and that directory is now under version control with git.</p>

        <div class="note">

      </section>

      <section class="sect2" id="committing_and_pushing">
        <h2>Committing and Pushing</h2>

        <p>Now that you've got a local checkout of your project, you can open and edit the <em>.asciidoc</em> file. As explained in <a class="xref" href="intro_to_asc">Chapter 4</a>, AsciiDoc is a text-based markup language. You can use any text editor to edit the files. <a class="xref" href="editing_in_textmate">Figure 2-8</a> shows edits being made to this chapter in TextMate, a text editor for the Mac.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>Now it's time to commit the changes to the git repo. You can include a log message with <code>-m</code>. The <code>-a</code> means to include all changes.</p>

      <section class="sect2" id="fetching_and_pulling">
        <h2>Fetching and Pulling</h2>

        <p>You can also use git to pull down changes that were made in the wiki environment or by other contributors. There are two ways of downloading changes. One way is to use <code>fetch</code> followed by <code>merge</code>, as in this example:</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">$ git fetch
remote: Counting objects: 5, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)

From https://atlas-admin.oreilly.com/git/1230000000065
   cd86112..cba41ff  master     -> origin/master</pre>

        <p><code>fetch</code> downloads the changes. Now use <code>merge</code> to bring your local files up to date:</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">$ git merge origin
Updating cd86112..cba41ff
Fast-forward
 ch02.asciidoc |    3 ++-
 1 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)</pre>

        <p>Alternatively, you can use <code>pull</code>, which downloads the changes and merges them in with a single command:</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">$ git pull
remote: Counting objects: 8, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
remote: Total 6 (delta 4), reused 0 (delta 0)

      </section>

      <section class="sect2" id="resolving_conflicts">
        <h2>Resolving Conflicts</h2>

        <p>When you use <code>git merge</code> or <code>git pull</code>, git will attempt to combine all changes into one document. Sometimes, however, git will fail to combine the text and your AsciiDoc file will have a conflict. This situation may arise if, for example, two authors try to <code>push</code> changes to the same line of text. Conflict resolution is beyond the scope of this document, but the Git User’s Manual has an <a href="http://schacon.github.com/git/user-manual.html#resolving-a-merge">excellent overview</a> of git conflicts and how to resolve them.</p>

  <section class="chapter" id="building_and_debugging">
    <h1>Building and Debugging</h1>

    <p>You can use Atlas to build your book in three formats—PDF, EPUB, and KF8—whenever you like.</p>

    <div class="sidebar">
      <h5>Three Major Ebook Formats</h5>
      <p>You may be wondering about the three book formats that Altas produces. An overview of each follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The fixed-layout PDF format is undoubtedly familiar to you and remains <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/03/publishers-data-direct-sales-customers.html">most popular format</a> among customers who buy direct from O'Reilly. If your book ends up being printed, we will use a slightly modified version of the online-friendly PDF that Atlas outputs. </li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB">EPUB</a> uses a fluid layout, which means that the text reflows to fit the container in which it is presented. EPUB is sold by most major ebook retailers, with the exception of Amazon. You can read an EPUB with <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibooks/id364709193?mt=8">iBooks</a> on an iOS device, <a href="http://www.aldiko.com/download.html">Aldiko</a> on an Android device, and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/">Adobe Digital Editions</a> on your desktop.</li>
        <li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000729511">KF8</a> format is also a fluid format and is used by Amazon's Kindle platform. You can copy the KF8 that Atlas outputs to your Kindle, or you can preview it with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000729511">Kindle Previewer</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <section class="sect1" id="building_books">
      <h1>Building Books</h1>

      <p>To kick off a build, click on the Build tab. Then, select New Build, and you will be presented with a list of the files that you've created so far. Drag or click the files that you'd like to include in the build and select the ebook formats that you'd like generate, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#files_to_build">Figure 3-1</a>.</p>

      <div class="warning">
        <p>A few things to keep in mind when building books in Atlas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Atlas expects a file extension of <em>.asciidoc</em>, so please use that instead of <em>.asc</em>.</li>
          <li>When you trigger a build, Atlas automatically creates a <em>book.asciidoc</em> file that references the files that you choose to include in the build, so there is no need to add one.</li>
          <li>Do not include <em>book-docinfo.xml</em> file in the build. This metadata-only file is described in <a class="xref" href="#adding_metadata">Adding Metadata</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <figure id="files_to_build">
        <figcaption><span class="figure-label">Figure 3-1.</span> Select your ebook formats and files</figcaption>
        <img src="images/files_to_build.png" alt="A screenshot of the Atlas build screen interface"/>
      </figure>

      <p>The builds will change to a status of pending. Wait a few minutes, and then refresh the page. Assuming the builds were successful, you can download your files right from Atlas. If you run into an error, see <a href="#debugging_errors">Debugging Errors</a>.</p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>Build times vary based on the length of your book, but most builds finish within a few minutes. EPUB files build the fastest, PDF files the slowest, and KF8 files somewhere in between.</p>
      </div>

    </section>

    <section class="sect1" id="adding_metadata">
      <h1>Adding Metadata</h1>

      <p>If the title and copyright pages in your book builds are looking bare, you can optionally fill them in by adding a file called _book-docinfo.xml_ to your project via git (see <a href="#using_git_with_atlas">Using Git with Atlas</a>), and then adding the appropriate metadata using XML tags. Here is an example showing the metadata that you might like to include:</p>

      <pre class="programlisting">BOOK METADATA GOES HERE</pre>

      <p>When you create a new build, the metadata will be added to the title and copyright pages of your PDF. Note that you do not need to include the <em>book-docinfo.xml</em> file iself in the build. Atlas sees and picks up the metadata information automatically.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="sect1" id="debugging_errors">
      <h1>Debugging Errors</h1>

      <p>Book builds will sometimes fail. The most likely cause of a failure is that your AsciiDoc isn't structured in a syntactically valid way. When you trigger a build, Atlas transforms your AsciiDoc into DocBook XML 4.5 and, using the DocBook as a source, builds the book files. If one of your builds fails, Atlas will report the error, which should help you to fix it.</p>

      <p>For example, here is an Atlas error log for a PDF build that failed:</p>

      <pre class="programlisting">book.xml:291: element xref: validity error : IDREF attribute
linkend references an unknown ID "cloning_to_github"</pre>

      <p>In this case, the problem is that there is a cross-reference referring to an ID that does not exist. You can fix it by adding an ID to the appropriate block, as explained in <a href="#intro_to_asc">Chapter 4</a>.</p>

      <p>We realize that build failures can be tricky to troubleshoot, so we're working on improving the error messaging. Also, we've configured Atlas to be permissive enough so that it doesn't fail on minor errors. Please let us know about your experiences with troubleshooting build failures, and how Atlas can be improved to make the experience better.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/index.html">AsciiDoc</a> is a text document format for writing (among other things) books, ebooks, and documentation. It's similar to wiki markup—if you can write a Wikipedia article, then you'll have no problem with AsciiDoc. The main advantages of AsciiDoc are that it is easy to use and plays well with O'Reilly's publishing tools, including Atlas.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <h5>Use the Source, Luke</h5>
      <p>If you're viewing this document as a PDF, EPUB, or KF8, you're seeing the <em>output</em> from the AsciiDoc source, rather than the AsciiDoc markup itself. Since this chapter is intended as an introduction to the markup, it may be helpful to view the source, available at <a href="http://cdn.oreilly.com/atlas_docs.zip">http://cdn.oreilly.com/atlas_docs.zip</a>.</p>

    <section class="sect1">
      <h1>How Do I Get Started Writing?</h1>

      <p>There are two ways you can write with AsciiDoc in Atlas:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Write directly in the Atlas web interface.</strong> Simply click on the "Write" tab in Atlas. Select an existing chapter file to edit, or choose "New File" to create one.</li>
        <li><strong>Write in a text editor and add it to Atlas.</strong> You can add text to Atlas by pasting the text directly into the writing interface or by using git (see <a class="xref" href="using_git_with_atlas">Chapter 5</a>) to push your local <em>.asciidoc</em> files to the Atlas repository.
        </li>
      </ol>

        <h5>Text Editors</h5>
        <p>Looking for a text editor to use? If you're on Windows, you could try <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org">Notepad++</a>, or any other text editor. If you're on a Mac, TextEdit, <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> paired with an <a href="https://github.com/zuckschwerdt/asciidoc.tmbundle">AsciiDoc bundle</a>), or <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a>, are great choices. Or maybe you prefer old school vi or Emacs. That's okay, too.</p>

    <section class="sect1">
      <h1>Notes to Production</h1>

      <p>To leave a note to the Production team, please use a passthrough block with the Docbook <code>remark</code> element, like this:</p>

      <pre>&lt;remark&gt;Use a passthrough block like this for notes to production staff&lt;/remark&gt;</pre>

      <p>AsciiDoc does have specific markup for comments (two slash characters, like this: \\, followed by the comment text), but they do not get passed to the DocBook output by default. In order to make sure the Production team sees your comments, please use the DocBook passthrough method listed above. (See <a class="xref" href="#passthroughs">Passthroughs</a> for more info on DocBook passthroughs.)</p>

      <h1>AsciiDoc Markup Reference</h1>

      <p>This section illustrates some of the most common elements used in writing technical documentation. The <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html">AsciiDoc User Guide</a> and the <a href="http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc">AsciiDoc cheat sheet</a> are other helpful references, but the following sections will give you an overview of the markup you'll use most frequently, plus some customized markup that is specific to Atlas.</p>

      <p>If you can't find what you're looking for here or if you just need a quick answer, please don't hesitate to email our support team at <a href="mailto:toolsreq@oreilly.com">toolsreq@oreilly.com</a>.</p>

      <section class="sect2" id="text">
        <h2>Text</h2>

        <p>Regular paragraph text does not need any special markup in AsciiDoc. Just add a blank line both above and below each paragraph, and the first word in the paragraph should not have a space before it. Here are some example paragraphs in AsciiDoc:</p>

        <pre>This is an example paragraph written in AsciiDoc. See, it's just plain text; no special markup necessary! Do make sure there aren't spaces or manual indentations at the beginning of your paragraph text.

        This is a second example paragraph in AsciiDoc. Note that there's a line break and a blank line between paragraphs.</pre>

        <p>To learn how to add inline markup such as italics to your text see the <a class="xref" href="#INLINES">Inline Markup</a> section below.</p>

        <div class="sidebar">
          <h5>What's Going On, Anyway?</h5>

          <p>A general understanding of what is going on under the hood of Atlas will help you make the most of the system. When you build your book (as described in <a class="xref" href="#building_and_debugging">Chapter 3</a>), Atlas first converts the AsciiDoc to <a href="http://www.docbook.org/">DocBook XML</a> and then generates the book formats from that DocBook. For each AsciiDoc markup, there is an equivalent DocBook element. As long as the AsciiDoc markup uses the expected syntax, the conversion to DocBook (and then to the book formats) goes smoothly.</p>

          <p>If you get a build error, the most likely cause is an AsciiDoc markup error. Atlas provides error message logs to help you troubleshoot and fix syntax errors. Read more about building and debugging in <a href="#building_and_debugging">Chapter 3</a>.</p>

      </section>

      <section class="sect2" id="chapter_markup">
        <h2>Chapters</h2>

        <p>The top of each chapter file should begin with a chapter title preceded by two equals signs. It's good practice to always include a unique ID string above the chapter title, surrounded in double brackets, for example:</p>

        <pre>[[unique_chapter_id]]
          == Chapter Title
          Chapter text begins here.</pre>

      </section>

      <section class="sect2" id="headings_markup">
        <h2>Headings</h2>

        <p>There are multiple ways to mark up heading levels in AsciiDoc. We've chosen our favorite "delimited" style to show you below, but feel free to use the <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html#X17">two-line underlined heading</a> style if you prefer.</p>

        <div class="note">
          <p>Note that the levels described in the <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html">AsciiDoc User Guide</a> can be confusing: in AsciiDoc, the document (book) is considered level 0; generally a chapter will be at AsciiDoc level 1 (unless you're dividing the book into parts), and sections within chapters start at AsciiDoc level 3 (which is equivalent to DocBook <code>&lt;sect1&gt;</code>).</p>
        </div>

        <section class="sect3" id="sect1_markup">
          <h3>Top-level heading</h3>

          <p>Within a chapter, the first and highest heading level uses three equals signs:</p>

          <pre>=== Top-Level Heading</pre>

        </section>

        <section class="sect3" id="sect2_markup">
          <h3>Second-level heading</h3>

          <p>This heading level should only follow a top-level heading:</p>

          <pre>==== Second-Level Heading</pre>

        </section>

        <section class="sect3" id="sect3_markup">
          <h3>Third-level heading</h3>

          <p>This heading level should follow a second-level heading only:</p>

          <pre>===== Third-level heading</pre>

        </section>

      </section>

      <section class="sect2" id="part_markup">
        <h2>Parts</h2>

        <p>If you want to group your chapters into parts, navigate to the file that should be the first chapter in that part, and add the part markup above the chapter title. It’s good practice to always include a unique ID string above the part title, like so:</p>

        <pre>[[unique_part_id]]
          = Part Title

          [[unique_chapter_id]]
          == Chapter Title

          Chapter text begins here.</pre>

        <p>To add introductory text to a part, add this <code>partintro</code> markup after the part title, but before the chapter title:</p>

        <pre>[[unique_part_id]]
          = Part Title

          [partintro]

          --
          Insert introductory text here.
          --

          [[unique_chapter_id]]
          == Chapter Title

          Chapter text begins here.</pre>

      </section>

      <section class="sect2" id="preface_markup">
        <h2>Prefaces</h2>

        <p>A preface file should begin with the word <em>preface</em> in single brackets, followed on the next line by two equals signs and the preface title:</p>

        <pre>[preface]
          == Preface Title

          Preface text begins here.</pre>

      </section>

      <section class="sect2" id="add_dedication">
        <h2>Dedications</h2>

        <p>A dedication file should begin with the word <em>dedication</em> in single brackets, followed by a blank line and then the dedication title and text. The title must be present, but it will not render in the output:</p>

        <pre>[dedication]
          == Dedication

          This book is dedicated to my cat, Garfield.</pre>

        <p>Dedication pages render on their own page at the beginning of the book, before the table of contents.</p>

      </section>

      <section class="sect2" id="praise_markup">
        <h2>Praise Pages</h2>

        <p>Praise pages are marked up similarly to <a class="xref" href="#add_dedication">Dedications</a>, but you will add a special <code>role="praise"</code> attribute. For each item of praise, use the quote markup (discussed in <a href="#add_quotes">Quotes</a>):</p>

        <pre>["dedication", role="praise"]
          == Praise for Getting Started with Atlas

          [quote, Jane Doe]
          ____
          "This book is awesome."
          ____
        </pre>

        <p>Praise pages render at the beginning of the book, before the title page, and are not included in the regular page numbering of the book.</p>

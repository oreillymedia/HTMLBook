    <h1 class="title">Join the Publishing Revolution</h1>
    <p>Thank you for your interest in Atlas! Atlas is a wiki-like, git-managed authoring platform for creating books. If you haven't already, you may want to check out the <a href="http://atlas.labs.oreilly.com/getting_started">getting started video</a><a class="indexterm" data-primary="video" data-secondary="introduction to Atlas"/>.</p>

   <video class="video" src="media/welcome_to_atlas.mp4" controls="controls" preload="auto" width="500" height="300" poster="images/welcome_to_atlas.png"></video>

   <p>Some of the features of Atlas are as follows:</p>

   <dl>
     
     <dt>Simple markup</dt>
     <dd>Atlas supports <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/index.html">AsciiDoc</a> and, for simpler projects <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.</dd>

     <dt>Git backend</dt>
     <dd>If you have a book, you have a <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> repository and all of the power and convenience that comes with using git version control.</dd>

     <dt>Easy book and ebook builds</dt>
     <dd>Atlas lets you build your project in three formats at any time: Mobi (for the Kindle), EPUB (for most other ebook platforms), and PDF. Atlas also gives you tools to debug your ebook formats so that you can identify and fix problems quickly.</dd>

     <dt>An invitation system</dt>
     <dd>Add collaborators to your project at any time by simply sending an invite.</dd>

     <dt>Flexible writing options</dt>
     <dd>You can write directly within Atlas, but if writing in a web browser is not for you, no problem. Just use git to clone your book to a local machine and write in the text editor of your choice.</dd>

   </dl>

   <section class="sect1" id="howitworks">
     <h1>How It Works</h1>

     <ol>
     	<li>Receive an invite<a class="indexterm" data-primary="invitation"/> from an O’Reilly editor or another author and create an account.</li>
     	<li>Write in AsciiDoc, an open source text format developed by <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/">Stuart Rackham</a>. Each time you save a file, it will be logged into a git repository, so it’s always under version control.</li>
     	<li>When you're ready, build your book. Atlas interfaces with O’Reilly's publishing toolchain, generating PDF, EPUB, and Mobi files for you on the fly. Theebook files look just like those for sale on oreilly.com.</li>
     </ol>

     <p>Why bother with this, you ask? We're trying to create an appealing authoring process that will get you writing as quickly as possible.</p>

   </section>

   <section class="sect1" id="startwritingtoday">
     <h1>Start Writing Today</h1>

     <p>We’re just getting started with Atlas, and you can play a role in determining future development by using the platform to write your book. If you’re willing to use Atlas, we ask that you:</p>

     <ul>
     	<li>Write in AsciiDoc, which is the preferred formats for Atlas.</li>
     	<li>Provide feedback. Atlas is currently in alpha testing, and we need to hear from you to take the platform to the next level. To submit feedback, simply click on the Feedback tab within Atlas and create an Issue. You will need a GitHub account to create an Issue. If you’re not able or willing to provide feedback, Atlas might not be right for you at this time.</li>
     </ul>

     <p>If the above sounds good to you, then you’re the perfect candidate to work in Atlas. We’re eager to help you get started. Let’s revolutionize publishing together!</p>

  <section class="chapter" id="writehowyouwant">
  	<h1>Write How You Want</h1>

  	<p>When you are using Atlas to write your book, you have the option of writing in the wiki interface<a class="indexterm" data-primary="wiki interface"/> or locally on your own computer. This chapter covers each of those scenarios. As you write your book, you can jump back and forth between the two writing environments. As long as you are saving in the web interface or using git to `push` and `pull` from your local machine, you'll always be in sync.</p>

  	<div class="note">
  	  <h5>Get Your Gravatar</h5>
  	  <p>You<a class="indexterm" data-primary="gravatar"/> may notice that some users have personal icons in the Changes and Collaborators sections of Atlas. Those image icons are pulled in from <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a>, based on the user's email address. Set up your Gravatar to get a more personalized icon.</p>

  	<section class="sect1" id="workingintheatlaswiki">
  	  <h1>Working in the Atlas Wiki</h1>

  	  <p>If you've used a wiki before, you will find the Atlas interface to be very familiar. In the following sections, you'll learn how to create and edit new files in the wiki interface.</p>

  	  <aside class="sidebar">
  	  	<h5>Invite Some Collaborators</h5>
  	  	<p>Once you are working on a project in Atlas, you can invite additional collaborators<a class="indexterm" data-primary="collaborators" data-secondary="inviting" /> at any time. First, create your project. Then, click on the Collaborators tab. Enter the mail address of anyone you'd like to collaborate with on your project. If you choose a permission type of Collaborator, the invited author will have full read and write access to your project, via the wiki interface and the git repository.</p>
  	  	<p>You can also remove collaborators using the same Collaborators tab.</p>

        <h2>Creating New Files</h2>
        <p>When you create your book<a class="indexterm" data-primary="creating files"/> in Atlas, it will have no files, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#blank_slate">Figure 2-1</a>.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>Once you've created the file, you're ready to start writing!</p>

      </section>

      <section class="sect2" id="working_with_asciidoc_text">
        <h2>Working with AsciiDoc Text in Atlas</h2>
        
        <p>When you're working in the Atlas wiki interface, you will need to write in AsciiDoc.<a href="#ftn1" id="ftnref1" class="noteref">1</a> See <a class="xref" href="#intro_to_asc">Chapter 4</a> for an introduction to AsciiDoc markup.</p>

        <p>The Atlas wiki editor works just as you'd expect. Use the buttons to insert simple AsciiDoc markup. For example, <a class="xref" href="#atlas_editor">Figure 2-2</a> shows what happens when you click the H1 button.</p>

        <figure id="atlas_editor">
          <figcaption><span class="figure-label">Figure 2-2.</span> Use the Atlas wiki interface to write in your web browser</figcaption>
          <img src="images/atlas_editor.png" alt="A screenshot of the Atlas wiki interface" />
        </figure>

        <p>Once you've entered some text, click Save and your changes will be committed to a git repository that is created automatically each time you start a new book. Optionally, you can enter a log message<a class="indexterm" data-primary="entering a log message"/> before you click Save, and it will be included with the commit to the git repository, as show in <a class="xref" href="#log_message">Figure 2-3</a>. Read more about making the most of your git repository in <a class="xref" href="working_locally">Working Locally</a> and <a class="xref" href="#using_git_with_atlas">Chapter 6</a>.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>Note also that you can use the File Manager drop-down to jump to other files or to create new ones.</p>

      <section class="sect2" id="adding_images">
        <h2>Adding Images via the Atlas Interface</h2>
        
        <p>You can upload images to your book directly in the Atlas wiki interface. Click on Image manager and then select Choose File and finally Upload, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#image_upload">Figure 2-4</a>.</p>

        <figure id="image_upload">
          <figcaption><span class="figure-label">Figure 2-4.</span> Upload your images within Atlas</figcaption>
          <img src="images/image_upload.png" alt="A screenshot of the Atlas image uploader"/>
        </figure>

        <p>Once you've uploaded your image, Atlas will generate a thumbnail preview of that image, which you can see at any time by bringing up the Image manager.</p>

        <div class="note">
          <p>At this time, if you upload an image via git, the image will not have a thumbnail preview within the Image manager.</p>
        </div>

        <p>You can also use the Image manager to insert the AsciiDoc reference to that image:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Place the cursor where you'd like to insert the image within the text.</li>
            <li>Click on Image manager.</li>
            <li>Select the thumbnail preview of the image you've uploaded and click Insert (<a class="xref" href="insert_image_asciidoc">Figure 2-5</a>).</li>
          </ol>

        <figure id="insert_image_asciidoc">
          <figcaption><span class="figure-label">Figure 2-5.</span> You've uploaded the image; now reference it within your document</figcaption>
          <img src="images/insert_image_asciidoc.png" alt="A screenshot showing how to highlight and insert a reference to an image from the Atlas image uploader"/>
        </figure>

        <p>Once you click insert, Atlas will add AsciiDoc markup that looks something like the following to your document:</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">image::images/insert_image_asciidoc.png[]</pre>

        <p>Read more about figure and image markup in <a class="xref" href="#figures_and_other_images">Figures and Other Images</a> in <a class="xref" href="intro_to_asc">Chapter 4</a>.</p>

    <section class="sect1" id="tracking_changes_in_atlas">
      <h1>Tracking Changes in Atlas</h1>

      <p>Each time you save a change in the wiki interface or use git to push a change to your repository (as described in <a href="committing_and_pushing">Committing and Pushing</a>), Atlas displays that change on the Changes tab.</p>

      <figure id="changes_in_atlas">
          <figcaption><span class="figure-label">Figure 2-6.</span> An Atlas change box shows additions and deletions made to the text</figcaption>
          <img src="images/changes_in_atlas.png" alt="A screenshot of how Atlas displays edits to the text. Added text has a green background. Deleted text is crossed out and has a red background."/>
      </figure>

      <a class="xref" href="#changes_in_atlas">Figure 2-6</a> shows a change that was saved to the repository via a <code>git push</code>. In this change notification box, Atlas displays the author who made the change along with the log message used during <code>git commit</code>. If the author were to use the Save button on the wiki interface (instead of git), as explained in <a class="xref" href="working_with_asciidoc_text">Working with AsciiDoc Text in Atlas</a>, the change would be captured and displayed in the same way.

    </section>

    <section class="sect1" id="working_locally">
      <h1>Working Locally</h1>

      <p>Atlas sits on top of a git repository, giving you the flexibility to write how and when you want. For example, suppose you have a long flight and want to write edit on the plane. No problem—just pull down your book files, make your changes locally, and then push them back up when you're connected to the Internet again. Or perhaps you'd rather skip the wiki interface entirely and work on your local machine exclusively. That's fine too.</p>

      <section class="sect2" id="cloning_your_book">
        <h2>Cloning Your Book</h2>

        <p>In order to work locally, you will need to have <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> installed on your machine. The following section describes a few basic git commands to get you up and running, but see <a href="using_git_with_atlas">Using Git with Atlas</a> for more details around using git with Atlas.</p>

        <p>Once you have git installed, click on the Metadata tab in the Atlas interface to retrieve your git repository URL, as shown in <a class="xref" href="git_repo_url">Figure 2-7</a>.</p>

        <figure id="git_repo_url">
          <figcaption><span class="figure-label">Figure 2-7.</span> Grab your git repository URL from the Metadata tab</figcaption>
          <img src="images/git_repo_url.png" alt="A screenshot of the Metadata tab in Atlas showing the git URL"/>
        </figure>

        <p>Now that you have the URL, you can use git to clone it to your computer. Use the `git clone` command and enter your Atlas password. When you clone the repo, you can optionally add the name of the directory, like so:</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">$ git clone https://adam%40oreilly.com@atlas-admin.oreilly.com/git/1230000000065.git
   getting_started_with_atlas/

        <p>The <code>clone</code> command will download all of the files into a directory named <em>getting_started_with_atlas</em>, and that directory is now under version control with git.</p>

        <div class="note">

      </section>

      <section class="sect2" id="committing_and_pushing">
        <h2>Committing and Pushing</h2>

        <p>Now that you've got a local checkout of your project, you can open and edit the <em>.asciidoc</em> file. As explained in <a class="xref" href="intro_to_asc">Chapter 4</a>, AsciiDoc is a text-based markup language. You can use any text editor to edit the files. <a class="xref" href="editing_in_textmate">Figure 2-8</a> shows edits being made to this chapter in TextMate, a text editor for the Mac.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>Now it's time to commit the changes to the git repo. You can include a log message with <code>-m</code>. The <code>-a</code> means to include all changes.</p>

        <p>Now if you look in the Altas web interface, you will see the changes that you made locally reflected in the wiki interface.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="sect2" id="fetching_and_pulling">
        <h2>Fetching and Pulling</h2>

        <p>You can also use git to pull down changes that were made in the wiki environment or by other contributors. There are two ways of downloading changes. One way is to use <code>fetch</code> followed by <code>merge</code>, as in this example:</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">$ git fetch
remote: Counting objects: 5, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)

From https://atlas-admin.oreilly.com/git/1230000000065
   cd86112..cba41ff  master     -> origin/master</pre>

        <p><code>fetch</code> downloads the changes. Now use <code>merge</code> to bring your local files up to date:</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">$ git merge origin
Updating cd86112..cba41ff
Fast-forward
 ch02.asciidoc |    3 ++-
 1 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)</pre>

        <p>Alternatively, you can use <code>pull</code>, which downloads the changes and merges them in with a single command:</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">$ git pull
remote: Counting objects: 8, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
remote: Total 6 (delta 4), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (6/6), done.

        <p>Using <code>push</code> and <code>pull</code> to interface with your Atlas repo is the just the beginning of what you can do with git. Check out the <a href="http://gitref.org/">Git Reference</a> and <a href="#using_git_with_atlas">Using Git with Atlas</a> to learn what else is possible.</p>

      </section>

      <section class="sect2" id="resolving_conflicts">
        <h2>Resolving Conflicts</h2>

        <p>When you use <code>git merge</code> or <code>git pull</code>, git will attempt to combine all changes into one document. Sometimes, however, git will fail to combine the text and your AsciiDoc file will have a conflict. This situation may arise if, for example, two authors try to <code>push</code> changes to the same line of text. Conflict resolution is beyond the scope of this document, but the Git User’s Manual has an <a href="http://schacon.github.com/git/user-manual.html#resolving-a-merge">excellent overview</a> of git conflicts and how to resolve them.</p>

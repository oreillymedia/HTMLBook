    <p>Thank you for your interest in Atlas! Atlas is a wiki-like, git-managed authoring platform for creating books. If you haven't already, you may want to check out the <a href="http://atlas.labs.oreilly.com/getting_started">getting started video</a><a class="indexterm" data-primary="video" data-secondary="introduction to Atlas"/>.</p>

   <video class="video" src="media/welcome_to_atlas.mp4" controls="controls" preload="auto" width="500" height="300" poster="images/welcome_to_atlas.png"></video>

   <p>Some of the features of Atlas are as follows:</p>

   <dl>
     
     <dt>Simple markup</dt>
     <dd>Atlas supports <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/index.html">AsciiDoc</a> and, for simpler projects <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.</dd>

     <dt>Git backend</dt>
     <dd>If you have a book, you have a <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> repository and all of the power and convenience that comes with using git version control.</dd>

     <dt>Easy book and ebook builds</dt>
     <dd>Atlas lets you build your project in three formats at any time: Mobi (for the Kindle), EPUB (for most other ebook platforms), and PDF. Atlas also gives you tools to debug your ebook formats so that you can identify and fix problems quickly.</dd>

     <dt>An invitation system</dt>
     <dd>Add collaborators to your project at any time by simply sending an invite.</dd>

     <dt>Flexible writing options</dt>
     <dd>You can write directly within Atlas, but if writing in a web browser is not for you, no problem. Just use git to clone your book to a local machine and write in the text editor of your choice.</dd>

     <h1>How It Works</h1>

     <ol>
     	<li>Receive an invite<a class="indexterm" data-primary="invitation"/> from an O’Reilly editor or another author and create an account.</li>
     	<li>Write in AsciiDoc, an open source text format developed by <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/">Stuart Rackham</a>. Each time you save a file, it will be logged into a git repository, so it’s always under version control.</li>
     	<li>When you're ready, build your book. Atlas interfaces with O’Reilly's publishing toolchain, generating PDF, EPUB, and Mobi files for you on the fly. Theebook files look just like those for sale on oreilly.com.</li>
     </ol>

     <p>Why bother with this, you ask? We're trying to create an appealing authoring process that will get you writing as quickly as possible.</p>

   <section class="sect1" id="startwritingtoday">
     <h1>Start Writing Today</h1>

     <p>We’re just getting started with Atlas, and you can play a role in determining future development by using the platform to write your book. If you’re willing to use Atlas, we ask that you:</p>

     <ul>
     	<li>Write in AsciiDoc, which is the preferred formats for Atlas.</li>
     	<li>Provide feedback. Atlas is currently in alpha testing, and we need to hear from you to take the platform to the next level. To submit feedback, simply click on the Feedback tab within Atlas and create an Issue. You will need a GitHub account to create an Issue. If you’re not able or willing to provide feedback, Atlas might not be right for you at this time.</li>
     </ul>

     <p>If the above sounds good to you, then you’re the perfect candidate to work in Atlas. We’re eager to help you get started. Let’s revolutionize publishing together!</p>

  	<h1>Write How You Want</h1>

  	<p>When you are using Atlas to write your book, you have the option of writing in the wiki interface<a class="indexterm" data-primary="wiki interface"/> or locally on your own computer. This chapter covers each of those scenarios. As you write your book, you can jump back and forth between the two writing environments. As long as you are saving in the web interface or using git to `push` and `pull` from your local machine, you'll always be in sync.</p>

  	<div class="note">
  	  <h5>Get Your Gravatar</h5>
  	  <p>You<a class="indexterm" data-primary="gravatar"/> may notice that some users have personal icons in the Changes and Collaborators sections of Atlas. Those image icons are pulled in from <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a>, based on the user's email address. Set up your Gravatar to get a more personalized icon.</p>

  	  <h1>Working in the Atlas Wiki</h1>

  	  <p>If you've used a wiki before, you will find the Atlas interface to be very familiar. In the following sections, you'll learn how to create and edit new files in the wiki interface.</p>

  	  <aside class="sidebar">
  	  	<h5>Invite Some Collaborators</h5>
  	  	<p>Once you are working on a project in Atlas, you can invite additional collaborators<a class="indexterm" data-primary="collaborators" data-secondary="inviting" /> at any time. First, create your project. Then, click on the Collaborators tab. Enter the mail address of anyone you'd like to collaborate with on your project. If you choose a permission type of Collaborator, the invited author will have full read and write access to your project, via the wiki interface and the git repository.</p>
  	  	<p>You can also remove collaborators using the same Collaborators tab.</p>
